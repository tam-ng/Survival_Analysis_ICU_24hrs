# Survival_Analysis_ICU_24hrs

## Goal
Create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. 


## Business Use Case
- In clinical practice, estimates of mortality risk can be useful in triage and resource allocation
- Help hospital to:
  - determine appropriate levels of care
  - prepare discussions with patients and their families around expected outcomes
- Help payers to know how the health outcomes of their policyholders will be affected, so that payers can identify useful policies


## Current Challenges 
The problems with existing severity of illness systems are numerous: 
- They often lack generalizability beyond the patients on whom the models were developed, and
- The models are often proprietary, costly to use (APACHE scoring system…), and suffer from opaque algorithms. 


## Data
From MIT's GOSSIS community initiative 

Dataset of more than 90,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. 
This data is part of a growing global effort and consortium spanning Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States.
