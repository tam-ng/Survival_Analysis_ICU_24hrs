# Survival_Analysis_ICU_24hrs

## Goal
Create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. 


## Data
From MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, 

Dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe.
